/**
 * Given an HTML element, how a third element must be positioned relatively to it and an offset element from which it must be positioned
 * calculates the top or bottom, right or left properties to allow correctly placing that third element.
 *
 * IMPORTANT #1:
 * Changing the offsetEl can lead to bugs. This is due to the fact that by using the documentElement as a reference,
 * scrollbars are already counted inside the the measurements, while in other elements there is no such guarantee.
 *
 * IMPORTANT #2:
 * Previously the bottom property was calculated as it follows:
 * ret.bottom = offsetEl.scrollHeight - scrollTop - rect.top;
 * However, this brought on the following issue:
 * When an absolute element is created inside the body tag, and if neither the body or html tag have a position different from static,
 * then the absolute positioning is referred to the window object.
 * In other words, using bottom property on the absolute element would position it starting from a scrollTop = 0
 * margin bottom window, making all calculations useless. (Try it yourselves)
 * On the other hand, making the component set a position different from static on body or html tag has a lot of side effects:
 * 1 - other elements are influenced by this behaviour,
 * 2 - calculations would once again break down due to the positioning being referenced on an element different from document.
 * The solution was to position the element exactly on top of the 'el' element and then adding a negative translation to it
 * equal to its height.
 *
 * @name getElementOffset
 * @param el - The element relative to which the third element must be placed
 * @param positioning - How the third element must be placed in relation to el (if over or under, left or right aligned)
 * @param [offsetEl] - An optional parameter to specify from which scrollable element calculations must take place. Default: document.documentElement. Change at your own risk and fault: see full comment.
 * @returns the position in pixel to apply to the third element to be placed correctly.
